			<b>Earth</b> is the third planet from the Sun, the densest planet in
			the Solar System, the largest of the Solar System's four terrestrial
			planets, and the only astronomical object known to harbor life.
			<p>
			Viewing Earth from the unique perspective of space provides the
			opportunity to see Earth as a whole. Scientists around the world have
			discovered many things about our planet by working together and sharing
			their findings.
			<p>
			Some facts are well known. For instance, Earth is the third planet from
			the sun and the fifth largest in the solar system. Earth's diameter is
			just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of Venus. The four seasons
			are a result of Earth's axis of rotation being tilted more than 23 degrees.
			<p>
			Oceans at least 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) deep cover nearly 70 percent of
			Earth's surface. Fresh water exists in the liquid phase only within a
			narrow temperature span (32 to 212 degrees Fahrenheit/ 0 to 100 degrees
			Celsius). This temperature span is especially narrow when contrasted with
			the full range of temperatures found within the solar system. The presence
			and distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere is responsible for much
			of Earth's weather.
