			Dishonored 2 wants to be called a classic correct continuation, but it will not be entirely true. 
			The game indeed corrects many shortcomings of the original, where its strengths are more detailed.
			But if you did not like the first part, then the second one will not fix anything.
			It is completely built on the same mechanics and promotes the same values
			as the original game - it does not give new impressions, and you have to accept it.
			Next, I will tell why it is not even bad at all
