		Dashonored - a computer game in the genre of stealth action from the first person
		with elements of RPG, developed by the French company Arcane Studios. 
		The main designers of the game are the founder of the studio Rafael Kalantonio, 
		and also Harvey Smith, who worked on The Thief: Deadly Shadows and Deus Ex. 
		To participate in the development, Victor Antonov (Half-Life 2, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic), 
		who had previously worked with Arcane Studios, was invited to this project immediately
		<img src="img/news/new-01-01.png" class="cont-img">
			The game takes place in the fictional, epidemic-ridden city of Danwall, to a certain extent copied 
		from London in the Victorian era. The protagonist of the game, lord defender Corvo Attano, was falsely 
		accused of murdering the empress and thrown into prison. However, the remaining "loyalists" consider 
		it useful and help out by organizing an escape. Further, the supernatural being, known as the Alien, 
		is interested in his fate and gives Corvo the opportunity to take revenge on his enemies and restore 
		justice with the help of magical abilities. At the disposal of the player are both conventional weapons 
		and supernatural abilities given to the Alien, such as "Transfer" or "Universe". Missions are non-linear, 
		they can be traversed in several possible ways: when entering into fights with opponents, and by making 
		their way past them and remaining unnoticed, and their goals can not be killed at all if one finds an 
		appropriate way of neutralization.

		North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and
		almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a
		northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by
		the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south
		by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea.
			North America covers an area of about 24,709,000 square kilometers
		(9,540,000 square miles), about 16.5% of the earth's land area and about
		4.8% of its total surface. North America is the third largest continent by
		area, following Asia and Africa, and the fourth by population after
		Asia, Africa, and Europe.
			In 2013, its population was estimated at nearly 565 million people in 23
		independent states, or about 7.5% of the world's population, if nearby
		islands (most notably the Caribbean) are included.

		South America is a continent located in the Western Hemisphere, mostly in
		the Southern Hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the Northern
		Hemisphere. It is also considered as a subcontinent of the Americas, which
		is the model used in Spanish-speaking nations and most of South America.
			It is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east
		by the Atlantic Ocean; North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the
		northwest. It includes twelve sovereign states – Argentina, Bolivia,
		Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname,
		Uruguay, and Venezuela – and two non-sovereign areas – French Guiana,
		an overseas department of France, and the Falkland Islands, a British
		Overseas Territory (though disputed by Argentina). In addition to this,
		the ABC islands of the Netherlands and Trinidad and Tobago may also be
		considered part of South America.
			South America has an area of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq mi).
		Its population as of 2005 has been estimated at more than 371,090,000. South
		America ranks fourth in area (after Asia, Africa, and North America) and fifth
		in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America). The most populous
		countries are Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Peru.

		Australia officially known as the Commonwealth of Australia, is an
		Oceanian country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the
		island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's
		sixth-largest country by total area. Neighbouring countries include Papua
		New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and
		Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east.
			For about 50,000 years before the first British settlement in the late
		18th century, Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians, who spoke
		languages grouped into roughly 250 language groups. After the
		European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606, Australia's
		eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled
		through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26
		January 1788. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades; the
		continent was explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies
		were established. On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming
		the Commonwealth of Australia. Since federation, Australia has maintained
		a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal
		parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy comprising six states
		and several territories. The population of 24 million is highly urbanised
		and heavily concentrated in the eastern states and on the coast.
