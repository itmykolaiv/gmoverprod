			South America is a continent located in the Western Hemisphere, mostly in
			the Southern Hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the Northern
			Hemisphere. It is also considered as a subcontinent of the Americas, which
			is the model used in Spanish-speaking nations and most of South America.

			It is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and on the north and east
			by the Atlantic Ocean; North America and the Caribbean Sea lie to the
			northwest. It includes twelve sovereign states – Argentina, Bolivia,
			Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname,
			Uruguay, and Venezuela – and two non-sovereign areas – French Guiana,
			an overseas department of France, and the Falkland Islands, a British
			Overseas Territory (though disputed by Argentina). In addition to this,
			the ABC islands of the Netherlands and Trinidad and Tobago may also be
			considered part of South America.

			South America has an area of 17,840,000 square kilometers (6,890,000 sq mi).
			Its population as of 2005 has been estimated at more than 371,090,000. South
			America ranks fourth in area (after Asia, Africa, and North America) and fifth
			in population (after Asia, Africa, Europe, and North America). The most populous
			countries are Brazil, Colombia, Argentina, Venezuela and Peru.

			Australia officially known as the Commonwealth of Australia, is an
			Oceanian country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the
			island of Tasmania, and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's
			sixth-largest country by total area. Neighbouring countries include Papua
			New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and
			Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east.

			For about 50,000 years before the first British settlement in the late
			18th century, Australia was inhabited by indigenous Australians, who spoke
			languages grouped into roughly 250 language groups. After the
			European discovery of the continent by Dutch explorers in 1606, Australia's
			eastern half was claimed by Great Britain in 1770 and initially settled
			through penal transportation to the colony of New South Wales from 26
			January 1788. The population grew steadily in subsequent decades; the
			continent was explored and an additional five self-governing crown colonies
			were established. On 1 January 1901, the six colonies federated, forming
			the Commonwealth of Australia. Since federation, Australia has maintained
			a stable liberal democratic political system that functions as a federal
			parliamentary democracy and constitutional monarchy comprising six states
			and several territories. The population of 24 million is highly urbanised
			and heavily concentrated in the eastern states and on the coast.
